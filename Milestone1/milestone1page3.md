🔁 General Advice
Weekly Check-ins: Hold short syncs to track progress and update your GitHub.
Use Branching in GitHub: Separate dev/model/frontend branches for clean commits.
Document Early: Comment your code and maintain a project log or changelog.

You said:
can you reduce the timeline to this format: Week 1: Define project scope, collect and preprocess the dataset.
● Week 2: Implement and fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model.
● Week 3: Evaluate the model and optimize hyperparameters.
● Week 4: Build a FastAPI-based backend to serve predictions.
● Week 5: Develop a simple front-end interface for uploading reviews and viewing results.
● Week 6: Test the system, gather feedback, and deploy the application.

Absolutely! Here's a streamlined 6-week timeline for your AI web app project, matching your format and maintaining alignment with your key deliverables:

Week 1 (June 20–June 26):
Define project scope, finalize problem statement, and design system architecture.
Collect and preprocess the dataset.

Week 2 (June 27–July 3):
Implement and fine-tune a pre-trained AI model (e.g., BERT or chosen model).
Train on your dataset and log initial results.

Week 3 (July 4–July 10):
Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).
Optimize hyperparameters and improve model performance.

Week 4 (July 11–July 17):
Build a FastAPI-based backend to serve predictions from the trained model.
Begin testing endpoints locally.

Week 5 (July 18–July 24):
Develop a simple front-end interface (HTML/CSS or React) for user interaction.
Connect front-end to FastAPI backend.

Week 6 (July 25–August 1):
Test the full system end-to-end.
Fix bugs, gather feedback, and deploy the web app (e.g., to Azure).
Finalize documentation and GitHub cleanup.
