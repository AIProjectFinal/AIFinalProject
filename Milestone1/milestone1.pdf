1.Project Overview
‚óè Project Title: Food Finder
‚óè Problem Statement: A user is visiting a restaurant for the first time and is unfamiliar with the menu. They need to avoid certain foods due to allergies, food sensitivities, etc
‚óè Objectives and Goals: Outline the primary objectives and expected outcomes. Define what success will look like for this project.
Help users choose restaurant. 
Help users plan and budget at restaurant for a party.
Help new customers order find the best option
Help users choose which meal they should get based on cost and preferences
2.Scope and Use Case
‚óè Target Audience: Identify who will use or benefit from the project‚Äôs outcomes.
Young Adult and older 
People w/ food allergies and sensitivities 
‚óè Use Case Scenarios: Detail specific scenarios where the project‚Äôs solution would be
applied. Describe the anticipated impact or benefits of the project in these cases.
A tourist unfamiliar with the area looking for places to eat dinner. 
‚óè Project Constraints: List any known limitations, such as data availability, time, or
computational resources.
Data - we are using publicly available datasets from Kaggle
Time - we have about 9 weeks to complete the project
Money - we are using low cost computing resources
3.Data Requirements
‚óè Data Sources: Describe where you will obtain the data needed to train or fine-tune your model. Specify if the data will come from open-source datasets, generated data, or
proprietary sources.
The data will come from an open-source dataset containing menu items from Doordash.
We may also consider getting data from web scraping and having a user upload information from a picture. 
‚óè Data Preprocessing Needs: Identify any preprocessing steps, like cleaning, feature
selection, scaling, or augmentation.
The dataset would need to be scaled, we would need to select the features that we need most, such as the name of the menu item. We would need to use data augmentation in order to include more menu items. 
‚óè Data Labeling: Specify if labeled data is needed and how labeling will be handled (e.g.,
manual labeling, pre-existing labels, or automated techniques).
We would need to label the data with tags in order to determine if the recipes fit specific dietary restrictions, such as containing allergens. The data doesn‚Äôt seem to have pre-existing labels that have the dietary restrictions, so we would need to do it preferably with automated techniques, even though we may need to do it manually.
4.Model Selection
‚óè Model Type: State whether the model will be:
‚óã Fine-tuned from a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT, ResNet, GPT)
‚óè Model Justification: Explain why this type of model is the best fit for the problem,
referring to its strengths and applicability.
Pretrained models are trained on large amounts of data. Our project is going to use a very large dataset (menus from restaurants) and given the time constraints of the project, I believe that the pretrained model will be the best choice to handle this project.
‚óè Transfer Learning (if applicable): If fine-tuning, specify the pre-trained model to be
used and the rationale for choosing it.
We can use transfer learning to fine-tune information about the ingredients.

‚úÖ 1. Project Proposal Submitted
Due: June 20

Includes: Problem statement, system design, dataset selection, and GitHub setup.

Milestone Outcome: Clear plan and direction for the AI project, approved by instructor.

üß† 2. AI System Prototype Completed
Due: July 10

Includes: Preprocessed dataset, working AI model (partially or fully trained), performance evaluation, and current results.

Milestone Outcome: A functioning AI model that demonstrates feasibility and direction.

üíª 3. Web App Progress Demonstrated

üöÄ 4. Final System Deployed and Presented
Due: August 28

Includes: Fully deployed AI web app on Azure, final report, and presentation/demo.

Milestone Outcome: A completed, live product with full documentation, ready for evaluation.
6.Evaluation and Testing Plan
‚óè Testing Environment: Describe the environment and tools to test the model and
application, including Quality Assurance, device testing, or A/B testing approaches.
We will deploy the application in a cloud environment like Render. We will test the model using device testing and A/B testing approaches.
‚óè User Feedback Collection: Explain any plans to gather and incorporate user feedback.
We will get user feedback from classmates, friends, family and instructors.
‚óè Error Handling and Monitoring: Detail any processes to track and address model
performance issues in production.
Monitor results and log any incorrect outputs. Retrain the model with more information to improve the accuracy.
7.Ethical and Responsible AI Considerations
‚óè Data Privacy: Explain how data privacy will be handled, especially if working with
sensitive information.
We are only going to collect the minimum amount of data necessary from the user in order for the app to be functional. We will avoid collecting identifying information. If we do collect personal data, we will get user consent before doing so. We will tell the user how their information is collected and used in the app. 
‚óè Fairness and Bias: Address any potential biases in the model or data and outline
strategies to mitigate them
It needs to be inclusive. It would need to have accurate and complete data so that it doesn‚Äôt accidentally exclude dishes that the user would enjoy safely. The AI may struggle with ingredients that from other countries. It may a healthy bias. It will need disclaimers because the AI infers ingredients.
‚óè Environmental Impact: Discuss any plans to monitor or limit computational costs if
large models are used, or consider tools to measure environmental impact (e.g., carbon
tracking).
One strategy that we were considering was using transfer learning. We could also use a smaller more efficient model. We could use a pretrained model.
8.Project Outcomes and Impact
‚óè Expected Impact: Summarize how the project will benefit users or stakeholders.
It will help users identify foods that they can eat safely. It will also help them to budget and plan for meals. 
‚óè FutureExtensions: Briefly outline any potential future work or enhancements that could
follow this project.
They could click on a menu item and pictures of that specific item will pop up. They will be able to get a list of common ingredients when they click on an item. They will be able to take a picture of the menu and the app will be able to extract menu information. We will create the app as a mobile app and integrate it into the kiosks that they have at restaurants. 
9.References
‚óè Resources and Research: Include any academic papers, articles, or tools that provide
foundational information or inspiration for the project.
‚óè Data Sources: Reference all datasets or data providers.

10. Appendix

I used ChatGPT in order to create the timeline for the project in order to save time. I thought that it would do a better job with estimates of how long it would take to do each part because it is the first time Felicia and I are doing this type of project.
